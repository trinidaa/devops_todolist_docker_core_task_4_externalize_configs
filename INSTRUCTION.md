## Short Summary on Environment Variables and Docker Compose

Using environment variables is a must-have practice when
working with Docker Compose. It allows for better 
configuration management, enhances security by keeping 
sensitive information out of the codebase, and provides 
flexibility across different environments (development,
testing, production). Employing environment variables is
considered one of the best practices in Docker Compose 
usage, making your applications more robust and easier to
maintain.
